I wanted to get familiar with non-relational databases and i found mongoDB.
this is very simple application where i use CRUD operations with MongoDB
creating collections, read and, or queries, IN queries, update, delete
Pagination example,
sorting documents
getting documents by Sub document field
getting documents by Array Value
starts query.
